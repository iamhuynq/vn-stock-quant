"""Regime Engine (docs/regime-interaction-plan.md, part 1): point-in-time market regime labels per session.

Built inside `quant build` into `market_regimes`. Continuous dimensions are labelled by the tercile of today's
value within the trailing window of sessions (today included); no threshold is tuned. The risk composite is
the rule declared in the plan before any outcome was looked at.
