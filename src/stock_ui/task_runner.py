"""Detached runner for one UI task: `python -m stock_ui.task_runner <data_dir> <run_id>`.

Started by stock_ui.tasks.start as the leader of a new process group. Takes the pipeline lock
(unless the task is daily.sh, which takes it itself), runs the command with output to the run log,
records the exit code, and releases the lock. SIGTERM (Cancel) reaches the whole group; the runner
itself keeps going until the command has exited, so the record and the lock are always cleaned up.
